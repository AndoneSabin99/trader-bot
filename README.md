## Buy low - sell high bot (Sabin Andone) (WIP)
The trader bot which will be discussed in this section adopts a simple yet effective approach to commercialize goods with the market this bot interacts with. The strategy consists of buying goods at the lowest price possible from all markets, computing from which one of them we can buy a certain good cheaply, and we try to trade all the EURs that the trader has at its own disposal in order to get the maximum amount of the good we bought. Then, we sell the good we just bought at a high price, by computing the highest quantity of EURs possibly attainable from all markets and we try to sell the highest amount of that good in order to get the highest amount of EURs possible. Repeat again for i interactions to gai more profit.
